# dataton_sibecol_2019  

**Eco-Dataton** - collaborative analysis of ecological data (4-5 h. / 8-25 participants / free of charge)    
**When:** Monday 4th February 2019.   
**Organizers:** Hugo Saiz (Universidad Rey Juan Carlos) & Ignasi Bartomeus (Estación Experimental de Doñana)   
**Recommendations:** basic knowledge on R and Github / own laptop with R and Rstudio  

Datatons are data analysis meetings where people cooperate to solve questions of interest by using different datasets. The aim of these meetings is to enhance collaboration between the participants and to develop innnovative solutions to scientific problems. From the Ecoinformatics working group from AEET, this year we propose for the first time to carry out a Dataton based on Ecological questions. In the spirit of SIBECOL, we aim to tackle pluralistic questions that permeate the borders of specific disciplines or study systems. The participants will meet for a day to discuss and develop innovative ways to fill current gaps in ecological theory by using datasets provided by the organizers. Participants will get an introduction about the datasets and the questions to be answered, will organize in working groups to cooperatively solve these questions, and will meet for a final discussion to present and evaluate the different approaches developed during the event. Participants will learn different methodologies to solve problems, establish collaborative bounds with other ecologists and plant the first seeds for future scientific collaborations.  

As an initial idea we will colate existing data containing species occurrences for different taxa in the Iberian Peninsula. Each group will focus on their taxa of interest and tasks include: getting the data, cleaning the data, summarizing and plotting the data and doing any simple analysis of their interest. Ideally, all data can be combined to build a *shinny* style app that visualizes the correlations among taxa.
